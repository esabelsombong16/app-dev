<H1>  My Current Favorite Series <H1>
  <H5>
 <p> Recently I have watched Wednesday Addams
   in NETFLIX. It's a story of a girl with NO emotions,
   no symphathy and a obsessed writer who loves killing genre.
   <p>
 <p> Everyone actully know his story because duh? It's been
    decades since the first Addams family series which
    is Wednesday is included.
    <p>
    
 <p> I don't want to share the whole story with you 
      because I'm so <strong>LAZY<strong> to type. It's better if 
      you will watch it in your own. Swear it's not
      a waste of time. üëç
      <p>
 <p> I may not share the whole story with you but I will share to you the most important cast
   I'll make a check list for you so that you can check each character out.
   Thank me later alright? üòâ
